            <p>For the last decade, members of the <a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-does-lgbtq-mean-5069804" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LGBTQ+</a> community have been striving to be accepted by the public. Ellen Degeneres, RuPaul, Caitlyn Jenner, and Tyler Oakley are some of the members who have used their celebrity status to promote acceptance with the LGBTQ+ community. With the help of large influencers and social media, LGBTQ+ members are becoming more widely accepted today. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Why is healthcare important for this community? Healthcare’s goal is based on the WHO’s (World Health Organization) definition of health, “health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” As this community grows to acknowledgement, healthcare must consider the quality of care delivered to them and include their health necessities. According to a <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2017.1422944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">research</a> study done in 2018, healthcare for the LGBTQ+ community has not met the WHO’s standards of health. Studies state that there is a <b>health disparity</b> in the LGBTQ+ community compared to heterosexual/cisgender people. Why is that?</p>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/healthequity/index.htm">Health equity</a> is when every person’s health goals are met and have the <b>same result</b>. Like the small cartoon at the top of the paragraph, equity and equality have a difference. Equality is giving everyone the same treatment while equity strives to specialize treatment to get the overall best result. Equity is the goal that healthcare providers strive to meet. They want everyone to be healthy at the same baseline. </p>
            <br>
            <p>If health equity is the good goal, then what is the opposite? That would be a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/foundation-health-measures/Disparities">health disparity</a>. Going with the logical opposite definition, health disparity would mean not meeting that equal quality health standard. In a health disparity, the health outcome is seen way less in a certain population than the rest.</p>

                Health disparities in the LGBTQ+ community include…
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased suicidal rates</li>
                    <li>Lower access to healthcare</li>
                    <li>Increased depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders</li>
                    <li>Increased violence (physical and emotional)</li>
                    <li>Increased risky behavior (alcohol, smoking, etc.)</li>

From a 2015 internet survey consisting of 2590 American MSM (men who have sex with other men), results showed how the stigma of being LGBTQ+ has affected them:
                <ul>
                    <li>56.7 % verbal harassment</li>
                    <li>50% family gossip</li>
                    <li>31.8% scared of being in public</li>
                    <li>28.2% feared rejection by friends</li>
                    <li><b>27.4% fear seeking healthcare</b></li>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><b>How can Healthcare Providers Improve Health Equity?</b></p>
            <ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 0;">
                Best way to improve the health equity in the LGBTQ+ members is to get to know them more. Just like learning about different languages and cultures, LGBTQ+ members have their own way to refer to themselves as and ways to respect each other. So ask, ask, ask! Assumptions will never give a good result. Here’s some steps:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Don’t assume the name on the chart is something they want to use</li>
                    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>“Hi my name is [insert name] and I will be working with you today. How would you like me to address you today?”</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Ask patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity</li>
                    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>“How do you identify your sexual orientation?”</li>
                        <li>“What was your sex assigned at birth?”</li>
                        <li>“What is your gender/gender identity?”</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Trust patients and learn from them</li>
                    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Patients will know themselves best and how they want to be treated</li>
                        <li>Build that relationship with them!</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0;"><b>Hope for the Future</b></p>
            <p>With growing acceptance to LGBTQ+ community, healthcare must forward its health practices to increase the health equity of the community. Hopefully with the suggestions above, healthcare providers can continue to learn and grow and to give high quality care to every patient no matter the sexual orientation and gender identity. </p>
