            <p>With the world and healthcare undergoing rapid changes, it is important to consider the quality services provided. For the last decade, members of the LGBTQ+ community have been driving to get their voices heard and to be accepted by the public for who they are. Ellen Degeneres, RuPaul, Caitlyn Jenner, and Tyler Oakley are some of the members who have used their celebrity status to promote acceptance with the LGBTQ+ community. With the help of large influencers and social media, LGBTQ+ members are becoming more widely accepted today. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Why is healthcare important for this community? Healthcare’s goal is based on the WHO’s (World Health Organization) definition of health, “health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” According to <a target="_blank" href="https://www-tandfonline-com.mutex.gmu.edu/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2017.1422944">research</a>, healthcare for the LGBTQ+ community has not caught up with the changing times and there is a <b>health disparity</b> between commuity members and their heterosexual/cisgener counterparts. Why is that?</p>

            <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cdc.gov/chronicdisease/healthequity/index.htm">Health equity</a> is when every person’s health needs are met and have the same result regarding what treatment they get. Like the small cartoon at the top of the paragraph, equity and equality have a difference. Equity is the goal that healthcare providers strive to meet. They want everyone to be healthy at the same baseline.</p>
            <br>
            <p>If health equity is the good goal, then what is the opposite? That would be a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.healthypeople.gov/2020/about/foundation-health-measures/Disparities">health disparity</a>. Going with the logical opposite definition, health disparity would mean not meeting that equal quality health standard. In a health disparity, the health outcome is seen way less in a certain population than the rest.</p>

                Health disparities in the LGBTQ+ community include…
                <ul>
                    <li>Increased suicidal rates</li>
                    <li>Lower access to healthcare</li>
                    <li>Increased depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders</li>
                    <li>Increased violence (physical and emotional)</li>

From a 2015 internet survey consisting of 2590 American MSM (men who have sex with other men), results showed the various types of stigma:
                <ul>
                    <li>56.7 % verbal harassment</li>
                    <li>50% family gossip</li>

            <ol style="list-style: decimal; padding-left: 0;">
                Best way to improve the health equity in the LGBTQ+ members is to get to know them more. Just like learning about different languages and cultures, LGBTQ+ members have their own way to refer to themselves as and ways to respect each other. So ask, ask, ask! Assumptions will never give a good result. Here’s some steps:
                <br>
                <br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Don’t assume the name on the chart is something they want to use</li>
                    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>“Hi my name is [insert name] and I will be working with you today. How would you like me to address you today?”</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Ask patients about their sexual orientation and gender identity</li>
                    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>“How do you identify your sexual orientation?”</li>
                        <li>“What was your sex assigned at birth?”</li>
                        <li>“What is your gender/gender identity?”</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>Trust patients and learn from them</li>
                    <ol style="list-style: lower-alpha;">
                        <li>Patients will know themselves best and how they want to be treated</li>
                        <li>Build that relationship with them!</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
