        <p>Reflection:</p>
        <p>I think that the assignments that we had before the blog post were extremely helpful. When I started the blog, I was really not excited about condensing such a large scholarly article into a shorter blog post. The summary discussion board is what helped me the most. I was able to focus on what was the most important aspects of the article. I utilized finding key word that repeated throughout the article as well as utilising the conclusion part of the article.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I tried to make my blog post similar to the one that I posted on the blog analysis discussion board. I created the title heading and subheadings as the blog as well as author and date line were similar. The blog also has a leave comment post, so I made a separate part for leaving comments for my readers. The difference about writing this blog post is that it has a more informal style. I like that I am able to write in bullet point form, and that when I grab citations, I just had to link it in a word and have a hyperlink for readers to click. I was able to meet the expectations of the audience by providing concise information that is simple to read. I included an intro and definitions, the problem, and the possible solution. The vision that I had for the blog post to make it organized and to include pictures. I hoped to make it more informal but I do not know it I did it correctly.</p>
